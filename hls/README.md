This directory contains the Vitis HLS kernels for each of the Levenshtein Automata at varying edit distances. Because each kernel represents a single automaton, there is a single output bit that represents a match.

Automata generated from different GuideRNA sequences and be combined; they share the same inputs and the outputs would need to be concatenated.
